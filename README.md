# Android Calculator
Welcome to the workshop on Android development! This repository includes an example of a simple
calculator written for an Android device. The calculator includes a dark theme UI written in XML,
and underlying logic written in Kotlin. The algorithm used is one that converts given infix
expressions to postfix notation so they can be more easily solved.
